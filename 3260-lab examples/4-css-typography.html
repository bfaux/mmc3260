                <p> <img src="Images/bryanwebsiteproedit.jpg" alt="Bryan J. Faux" />   I am currently studying at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu">University of Florida</a> in the College of Journalism and Communications but I originally wanted to be a musical theater actor. I have participated in theater at various venues in my local community for the majority of my life. I studied acting and voice on and off for many years. I was an active performer at the <a href="http://gcplayhouse.org">Vam York Theater</a> in Gainesville, Florida for the past six years where I still ocassionally volunteer in other areas.</p><br>
                <br><p> I love the collaborative nature of theater and the way people can come together, connect to each other and an audience, as well as create art. I love to discuss art and popular culture and survey their impact on society. I often find myself reading <em>The New York Times</em> reviews of Broadway shows and I came to the realization that I was interested in writing critical analysis as well as commenting on the state of contemporary American theater.</p><br>
                <br><p>With the digital age of social media, podcasts, and blogs everyone has something to say about popular culture and all it's many forms. I realized I wanted to be in a profession where I could give my statement or opinion and potentially have my opinion <em>matter</em>.  Although this is not the only aspect of journalism, I find it to be an important one.  I strive to be a better writer and storyteller which stems from my experiences in the performing arts. I want to be a part of the ongoing discussion of art and culture in unique and contemporary ways and connect with others through that very discussion.</p>
